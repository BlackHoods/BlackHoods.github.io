      <description>Hey there, my name is Diego. I am a simple guy who is currently working as security analyst in Ireland. I use to play CTFs so the idea to create a simple blog to post some of their solutions came soon to my mind.
Inside computing security I am mainly, but not uniquely, interested in:
 Reverse engineering. Exploitation in general (binaries, web, etc). Device hacking.  One friend and I ran this site as a hobbie.</description>

      <description>Is curious that this specific challenge had more value than the previous one (pwn3).
As we will see below, it was way easier. Lets take a look with r2.
$ wget -q https://github.com/BlackHoods/BlackHoods.github.io/raw/master/assets/TamuCTF2017/pwn4/pwn4 $ r2 -A -c &amp;#39;afl&amp;#39; pwn4  [x] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa) [x] Analyze len bytes of instructions for references (aar) [x] Analyze function calls (aac) [x] Use -AA or aaaa to perform additional experimental analysis.</description>

      <description>And here we are, with another pwning challenge üòÅ.
$ wget -q https://github.com/BlackHoods/BlackHoods.github.io/tree/master/assets/TamuCTF2017/pwn3 $ r2 pwn3  Once downloaded and opened with radare2, go for it and list its functions.

      <description>We are given a source code file and a binary which is being run remotely. Let&amp;rsquo;s a analyze it with radare2:
$ wget https://github.com/BlackHoods/BlackHoods.github.io/raw/master/assets/TamuCTF2017/pwn2/pwn2 $ r2 pwn2  [0x08048450]&amp;gt; aaa [x] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa) [x] Analyze len bytes of instructions for references (aar) [x] Analyze function calls (aac) [x] Use -AA or aaaa to perform additional experimental analysis.

      <description>We are told that there is a binary running remotely and its code is available to download. Lets download and open it with r2.
$ wget https://ctf.tamu.edu/files/7e968d03d9caa11a2f4f2909bd3cabc9/pwn1 $ r2 -A pwn1   At some point the link will be broken, if so you can use the one from the repository.
 Now that the binary is opened, lets see some stuff inside it.
