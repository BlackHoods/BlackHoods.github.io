#### About me

Hey there, my name is Diego. I am a simple guy who is currently working as security analyst in Ireland. I use to play CTFs so the idea to create a simple blog to post some of their solutions came soon to my mind.

Inside computing security I am mainly, but not uniquely, interested in:

- Reverse engineering.

- Exploitation in general (binaries, web, etc).

- Device hacking.

One friend and I ran this site as a hobbie. We will keep it updated with solutions, projects or simply stuff we consider interesting and curious to know, as much as our respectives jobs allow us.

Hope you all enjoy it.  
Cheers!
